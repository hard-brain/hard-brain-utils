# hard-brain-utils
Utility scripts for processing IIDX GSTs for use with Hard Brain. One script can be used to generate the song_data.json file used by hard-brain-api to seed the database with song data. The other script uses FFMPEG to transcode GST songs to mp3.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- FFmpeg

## Disclaimer

These scripts are not regularly maintained and will likely need modifying to work with your GST. Your mileage may vary.
